        <p>Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. All kinds of happy little splashes. The man who does the best job is
            the one who is happy at his job. All those little son of a guns. Let's have a happy little tree in here.</p>
        <p>Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. Let all these things just sort of happen. If what you're doing doesn't
            make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing.</p>
        <p>Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just
            let them happen. Everybody needs a friend. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very
            important. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the
            house or taking it out on your spouse. Let's have a nice tree right here.</p>
        <p>No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Take your time. Speed will come
            later. You can get away with a lot.</p>
        <p>If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. It's cold,
            but it's beautiful. Let that brush dance around there and play.</p>
        <p>Let's make a nice big leafy tree. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Brown is such
            a nice color.</p>
        <p>Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Everybody's different. Trees are different.
            Let them all be individuals. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and
            expect it will get better. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and
            squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into
            your world.</p>
